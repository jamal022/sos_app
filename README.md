# sos_app
The SOS (Save our Skin) application is a mobile application developed using Flutter and Firebase, designed to provide efficient burn degree detection and medical assistance to users. The app utilizes a powerful neural network architecture called MobileNetV2, which has been deployed on the mobile device using TF-Lite.

One of the key features of the SOS app is its ability to accurately detect burn degrees, including first, second, and third degree burns. By leveraging the capabilities of MobileNetV2, the app analyzes images of burns provided by the user and classifies them into the appropriate burn degree category. This classification process enables users to quickly understand the severity of the burn and take appropriate action.

After the burn degree is determined, the SOS app generates a comprehensive report for the patient, providing crucial information about the burn, its degree, and recommended treatment options. The report serves as a valuable resource for both the patient and medical professionals, ensuring that appropriate medical attention is sought in a timely manner.

The application also includes a location-based feature that recommends the nearest doctors specialized in burn treatment. By utilizing the user's location data, the SOS app suggests qualified medical professionals who are in close proximity to the user. This functionality facilitates swift access to medical assistance, enhancing the overall user experience and ensuring prompt treatment for burn injuries.


Moreover, the SOS app incorporates a chat feature, enabling patients to directly communicate with doctors. This real-time interaction allows users to seek professional advice, ask questions, and receive personalized guidance regarding their burn injuries. The app fosters a supportive environment by establishing a Q&A community, enabling patients to share their experiences and gain knowledge from others who have faced similar burn-related challenges.
